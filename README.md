# Schedule Export Frontend

## Important Notice: Due to the introduction of 2FA on the Student Center, it has become too costly for me to continue hosting this web app. This is because Selenium is required to complete the 2FA process. However, you can still use this tool on your local machine by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/ameenalasady/uwoTimetableCSV).

This repository contains the frontend code for the Schedule Export web application. The application is built using React.js and allows students to easily export their class schedule to be imported into any schedule management app.

## Usage

To run the application locally, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Link to the Webapp

You can access the live version of the webapp [here](https://western-schedule-exporter.web.app/).

## Link to the Backend Repository

The backend for this application can be found [here](https://github.com/ameenalasady/ScheduleExporterBackEnd).
